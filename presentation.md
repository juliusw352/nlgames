# Presentation outline

### Introduction
- Nonlocal games: new(ish) theoretical construct in quantum computing/information
- May have impact on zero-knowledge proofs, cryptography

### Concepts  & definitions
- Explain nonlocal games

### Background
- Mention some literature
- Toqito

### Approach
- Technologies used
- Methodology
  - Project management
    - Mention issues encountered
  - How it changed
- Testing

### What did I do?
- What already exists, what will be done in the future
- Toqito contributions

### Conclusion
- Extremely interesting project
- Lots of potential

### Demo
- Calculate classical value of CHSH for $n=1, n=2, n=3$
- Use barak-rao-raz to prove(?) that chsh descends $0.75^n$
